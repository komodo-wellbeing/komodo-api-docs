To access the API you need to obtain an integration API key in Komodo. This can be done by
either:

-   Contacting Komodo to issue an organisation-based API key.
-   Generating an organisation-based API key in Komodo via Settings > Integrations > Create an Integration > Custom.

## Environments

There are currently two environments available to use the API in. Both of these require a region subdomain (e.g. `us.east1`). The full URL to use will be displayed in the Komodo Integration settings.

### Staging

This is our staging site, which is available to be used for API development & testing. Please contact Komodo for an API key for the staging environment.

**URL:** https://\{region\}.stage.api.komodowellbeing.com

### Production

This is our production site. This should only be used once API development & testing has been completed. An admin user can generate an API key for the production environment via the Komodo Integration settings.
